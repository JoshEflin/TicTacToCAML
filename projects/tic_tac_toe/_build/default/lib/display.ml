         At first glance, this might seem confusing, but here's a breakdown:
         
         The `let () = ... in` construct is used to handle side effects explicitly in OCaml. 
         When you write `let () = ... in`, you are:
         
         1. **Performing Side Effects**: `print_string` and other functions that produce `unit`
         are executed for their side effects (like printing to the console). The result of these 
         operations is `unit`, which means they donâ€™t produce a meaningful value.
         
         2. **Binding to `unit`**: The `let () = ...` construct binds the result of the side effect 
         (which is `unit`) to `()`. This indicates that you are acknowledging the side effect but not 
         using the result of the operation.
         
         3. **Function Return Value**: The entire function ends up returning `unit` because each 
         branch of the `match` expression (including recursive calls) either directly returns 
         `()` or results in a continuation that is also of type `unit`.
